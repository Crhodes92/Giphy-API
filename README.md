# Giphy-API

This was my initial foray into the world of APIs. I used the giphy api and jquery to dynamically generate images when you click a button. The button is through jquery and has the text of what you searched. I kept things simple in terms of css because simplicity works whenever you're looking at crowded content like gifs (see reddit for example). I'll be updating this project as my schedule clears up, don't hesitate to reach out to me if you have any questions or suggestions.
